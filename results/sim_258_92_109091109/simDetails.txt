This simulation was run with the following parameters:

Threshold = 2.58
Dimensions = [109, 91, 109]
Smoothing = 9.2

10 blocks of 5000 iterations were run.

Results included are:

- numPeaksPerClus.mat

    Loading numPeaksPerClus.mat gives the variable obsCountsFull.
    obsCountsFull(1:j, 1:k) shows the number of times that between 1 and k 
    peaks were observed in clusters of size 1 to j.
