This simulation was run with the following parameters:

Threshold = 2.58
Dimensions = [32, 32, 64]
Smoothing = 5.7

10 blocks of 5000 iterations were run.

Results included are:

- numPeaksPerClus.mat

    Loading numPeaksPerClus.mat gives the variable obsCountsFull.
    obsCountsFull(1:j, 1:k) shows the number of times that between 1 and k 
    peaks were observed in clusters of size 1 to j.

- numClus.mat

    Loading numClus.mat gives the variable occurencesFull.
    occurencesFull(1:j) shows the number of clusters that were observed of 
    size 1 to j respectively.
